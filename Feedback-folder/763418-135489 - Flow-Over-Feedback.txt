- Auto-Mark description:
Control stack exhausted (no more space for function call frames).
This is probably due to heavily nested or infinitely recursive function
calls, or a tail call that SBCL cannot or has not optimized away.

PROCEED WITH CAUTION.

- Test cases results:
((Pass TEST-DEPOSIT (NOT (DEPOSIT 10001)))
 (Pass TEST-WITHDRAW (EQUAL (WITHDRAW 60) 10))
 (Pass TEST-WITHDRAW (NOT (WITHDRAW 80)))
 (Pass TEST-WITHDRAW (NOT (WITHDRAW 10001)))
 (Pass TEST-WITHDRAW (EQUAL (WITHDRAW 20) 70))
 (Pass TEST-WITHDRAW (EQUAL (WITHDRAW 10) 90)))
